3. **Adoption Confirmation Modal**: This modality improves user involvement by showing a countdown once a user presses the adopt button.


4. **Category Filtering**: For a more customized browsing experience, users can filter pets by categories like dogs, cats, bunnies, and birds.


5. **Loading Spinner**: During the process of retrieving pet data, a visible loading spinner appears to give users feedback.


6. **Dynamic Data Rendering**: Fetches information from static datasets or APIs and presents it visually.


## ES6 Features Used

- **Arrow Functions**: Used for a clearer and more succinct function syntax; one of the ES6 features used.

- **Template Literals**: Backticks for multi-line strings were used to enable dynamic HTML content production.
